Fiat-bitcoin-URI
=============================

This application redirects from URIs containing fiat price data into bitcoin: scheme URIs. This enables static
(eg. printed) QR-codes that can be scanned by mobile phones, while the price in the QR-code is fixed in fiat.
Or, similarly, static Web links can be created with fixed fiat prices.
